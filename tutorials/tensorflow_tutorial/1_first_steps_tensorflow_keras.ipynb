    "**TensorFlow** is an open-source (from google) machine learning platform and symbolic mathematical library used for machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keras** is an open-source neural network library built on top of Tensorflow. It is fast and easy to use, So good for prototyping (not only prototyping).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tensorflow advantages:**\n",
    "- Good and great community support.\n",
    "- Debugging the sub-part of the graphs is possible\n",
    "- You can easily extend, change and add the code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keras advantages:**\n",
    "- You can easily construct and train neural networks\n",
    "- API is user friendly\n",
    "- Good community support on stack overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**So what do I choose and when?**\n",
    "- If you have large datasets and you want high performance, use tensorflow.\n",
    "- If you want to change something in the code or add custom code, use tensorflow.\n",
    "- If you want to inspect/debugg graphs, use tensorflow.\n",
    "- If you have small datasets and want to build neural networks fast which do not demand something special or some hacking, use keras."
